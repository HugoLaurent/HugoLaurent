### Hello there... ðŸ‘‹

## About me

:metal: Hey there! My name is **Hugo** and I'm currently in the process of becoming a **web developer** with **O'clock** school.

I've always been passionate about new technologies and the challenges they bring. That's why I decided to change my career path and become a web developer. ðŸ”¥

Right now, I'm honing my skills in web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks like ReactJS, and others. I'm also discovering back-end technologies with NodeJS.

I'd love to work on open-source projects on GitHub, as it would allow me to put into practice what I've learned and keep learning by working with experienced developers.

If you have any interesting projects you'd like me to work on with you, don't hesitate to contact me! I'm always up for new challenges and learning new things.

:v: See you soon!

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on some newbies projects
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript / Node.JS / API
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on everything I could 

ðŸš€STARSHIP FOR LIFEðŸŒ
